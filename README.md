# Tetris
Tetris is a classic puzzle game where players must arrange falling blocks, known as Tetriminos, to form complete horizontal lines. When a line is filled, it disappears, earning the player points. As the game progresses, the blocks fall faster, and the goal is to prevent the screen from filling up, which would result in a game over.
